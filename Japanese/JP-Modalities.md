## Volitional



## (Co)hortative
Hortative modalities (abbreviated HORT) are verbal expressions used by the speaker to encourage or discourage an action. Different hortatives can be used to express greater or lesser intensity, or the speaker's attitude, for or against it.  (Source: [Wikipedia][Wikipedia - Hortative]).  
 
 **Co**hortative specifically refers to the first-person plural version of hortative, in which the speaker invites the addressee to engage together in the action.

##### [動詞否定形][Polarity - Negation] (どうしひていかたち) / Negative form / 〜ない 
In Japanese, a negative verbal interrogation can express (ex/co)hortative towards the affirmative verb's action. 

This usage is highly contextual, even when hortative is implied the default modality seems to be exhortative rather than cohortative. To specify that the action should be undertook together (cohortation rather than exhortation), 一緒 or synonyms can be used.
This use of negative interrogation as a cohortative seems to be limited to the plain form.

##### Example:
*  __東京に行かない？__ ー _You're not going to Tokyo ? / Shouldn't you go to Tokyo ? / Shall we go to Tokyo ?_
* __一緒に食べない？__ ー _Shall we eat together ?_
